# 201-Group-Project

### Project By: Darran Holmes, Sheldon Pierce & Rhett Beardemphl

## Cooperation Plan

Our team is solid. We have Darran, he is a master at CSS3. He has never met a styling object he can't overcome. Then there is Sheldon, he is a JavaScript menace. He literally puts the Java in your script. Lastly we have Rhett, he is a talented manager. He will make sure everyone is at task all day long. He is only capable of laying out the skeleton on HTML5. Darran and Rhett have experience driving and navigating together. They will have no problems getting the website structured and styled. Sheldon will inject his JavaScript knowledge to store data locally and fire it to the page when needed. Rhett wants to develop greater strength in JavaScript, specifically localStorage. Darran wants to derive a greater overall confidence in creating and understanding logical statements in JavaScript. Sheldon wants to understand algorithms better so he can make robots in the future. We plan to approach our day-to-day work by meeting up in the mornings and discussing what we achieved the day before and what we are going to attempt to achieve today. 

## Conflict Plan

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

We will make sure to vote on features we want to add and be open about our issue we may be having.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

We will make sure we discuss what our jobs are and make sure we hold each other accountable.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Sheldon is already ahead of Rhett and I on knownlege but he as always done a good job of explaining things and catching everyone else up.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

We will give that person a task to complete of something that needs to get done.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
